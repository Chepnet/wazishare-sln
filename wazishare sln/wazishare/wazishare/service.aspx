            <p>LIPA NA AIRTIME is an application that was developed by the company to offer convenient payment solutions to NHIF subscribers in the entire country by using mobile phone daily airtime top up. The system relies on the fact that every household in the country at least has a mobile phone and therefore uses credit card for communication. Most people recharge their airtime almost on daily basis with different amounts.
The target population are the low income earners who uses as low as ksh.20 for airtime recharge on daily basis which approximately translates to ksh.600 per month. 
The minimum NHIF monthly contribution for those in informal employment is ksh.500 which is way below the monthly minimum airtime deducted. 
The system therefore seeks to exploit this opening so that the target population can use a percentage of daily airtime top up for payment of NHIF contributions. The daily amount deducted from daily airtime will be accumulated by the system for one month and submitted as NHIF monthly contributions on behalf of the user.
